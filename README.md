# Maze-Generator-in-VBA
Maze Generator in VBA using Depth-First Algorithm

In order to make this work you need to:
-Put all the subs and functions on Visual Basic in Excel
-Read the comments of the Sub "Generator"
-And when everything's set, just run the sub "Generator" in an empty sheet.

Have fun :)
